*Closed Captions* is a conceptual composition
based on closed captions of movies and TV series.
Captions can be extracted with their timestamps
from streaming platforms and converted using Matlab scripts.

In the performance, a Python-based
tool is used to play a set of captions,
presented to the musicians on a GUI.



### TNG Version
